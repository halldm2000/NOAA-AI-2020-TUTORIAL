### A Practical Introduction to Deep Learning for the Earth System Sciences, using PyTorch

In this tutorial, we will learn how to build deep learning applications from the ground up using PyTorch. We will begin simply and build toward full-fledged solutions for detecting tropical cyclones and other strong storms in model data and satellite observations. The primary goal of this tutorial is to familiarize you with each of the concepts and tools needed to begin building your own deep learning applications. Previous experience with Python and Numpy are desired, but not required.
